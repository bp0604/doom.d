;; To install a package with Doom you must declare them here, run 'doom sync' on
;; the command line, then restart Emacs for the changes to take effect.
;; Alternatively, use M-x doom/reload.


;; Doom's packages are pinned to a specific commit and updated from release to
;; release. The `unpin!' macro allows you to unpin single packages...
                                        ;(unpin! pinned-package)
;; ...or multiple packages
                                        ;(unpin! pinned-package another-pinned-package)
;; ...Or *all* packages (NOT RECOMMENDED; will likely break things)
                                        ;(unpin! t)


;; To install SOME-PACKAGE from MELPA, ELPA or emacsmirror:
                                        ;(package! some-package)

;; To install a package directly from a particular repo, you'll need to specify
;; a `:recipe'. You'll find documentation on what `:recipe' accepts here:
;; https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#the-recipe-format
                                        ;(package! another-package
                                        ;  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"))

;; If the package you are trying to install does not contain a PACKAGENAME.el
;; file, or is located in a subdirectory of the repo, you'll need to specify
;; `:files' in the `:recipe':
                                        ;(package! this-package
                                        ;  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"
                                        ;           :files ("some-file.el" "src/lisp/*.el")))

;; If you'd like to disable a package included with Doom, for whatever reason,
;; you can do so here with the `:disable' property:
                                        ;(package! builtin-package :disable t)

;; You can override the recipe of a built in package without having to specify
;; all the properties for `:recipe'. These will inherit the rest of its recipe
;; from Doom or MELPA/ELPA/Emacsmirror:
                                        ;(package! builtin-package :recipe (:nonrecursive t))
                                        ;(package! builtin-package-2 :recipe (:repo "myfork/package"))

;; Specify a `:branch' to install a package from a particular branch or tag.
;; This is required for some packages whose default branch isn't 'master' (which
;; our package manager can't deal with; see raxod502/straight.el#279)
                                        ;(package! builtin-package :recipe (:branch "develop"))

(package! centered-cursor-mode)         ; 光标垂直居中
;; (package! golden-ratio)         ; 选中的窗口自动黄金分割大小。

(package! pangu-spacing :disable t)     ;在org，doom默认配置了在中英文间插入空格。我不想插入空格，禁用pangu-spacing包。

(package! sis :recipe (:host github :repo "laishulu/emacs-smart-input-source")) ;原生输入法切换：smart-input-source ，配合evil使用更佳 https://github.com/laishulu/emacs-smart-input-source

(package! valign :recipe (:host github :repo "casouri/valign")) ; valign可以让Org Mode表格像素对齐，变宽字体也可以对齐。https://github.com/casouri/valign
